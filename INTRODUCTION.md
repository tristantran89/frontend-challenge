Hi reviewer, ðŸ‘‹

My focus on this challenge was on respecting the requirements, follow the wireframes provided and respect UI/UX fundamentals.

Few things that I included:
- Use of React Router to route different expected urls
- Add basic client-side validation to prevent as much as possible users from reaching last step where server request is submitted.
- Save form data in session storage to allow user to navigate between steps, be able to refresh page, etc. without losing input information during session.
- Responsive UI design
- Built LoadingComponent as a functional component. Chose this particular component which does not have any internal state.
